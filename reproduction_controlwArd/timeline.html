              After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, the government encouraged population growth to strengthen the nation.<br><br>
              Population policies during the 1950s and 1960s were affected by the Great Leap Forward, Cultural Revolution, the Great Chinese Famine, among others.<br><br>
              February 1965, the Family Planning Commission of the State Council held a “field experience-sharing” conference, and the slogan “one is not less, two are perfect and three are more” emerged.<br>

              - **late 1970s** - “One-child-per-couple” policy was delivered by the CPC Central Committee in *An Open Letter to All Members of the Communist Party and Communist Youth League - on the Issue of Controlling the Population Growth* <br><br>
- 1978 - establish family planning offices, appointment of full-time family planning officers - There was a need to change the mindset of parents that having more children didn’t mean better. On the other hand, the more children they had, the more likely they were to be stuck in poverty forever because of a lack of food and resources<br><br>
- 1981, establishment of the National Population and Family Planning Commission (materializing the policy)<br><br>
- **1982, Constitutional Amendment — Family planning was enshrined in the Chinese Constitution, making population control a legal mandate.**<br><br>

- 2000, the CPC Central Committee and State Council issued ***A Decision on Strengthening Population and Family Planning Work and Stabilizing a Low Fertility Rate***<br>
    - the population control was successful<br>
    - maintain the low birth rate and improve the population quality<br>
    - in general, each province was given the freedom to take charge of its policy on reduction of population and implementation of one-child rule (localization of the policy, certain degree of flexibility)<br><br>
- December 29, 2001 - the issue of ***People's Republic of China Population and Family Planning Law***<br><br>

              - May 31, 2021, in response to the 2020 census results, authorities in China announced an end to a policy limiting couples to up to two children and are encouraging couples to have three children.<br><br>
              - the results stirred concerns over the aging population, and low fertility rate in China<br><br>
              - This is a policy change accompanied by “**supportive measures...conducive to improving our country’s population structure**, fulfilling the country’s strategy of actively coping with an ageing population.” And it is expected that this policy “will improve the population structure of China.”<br><br>
          - However, according to a research by state news agency Xinhua (新华社), of 31,000 people polled, just 4.5% were ready to have a third child<br><br>
